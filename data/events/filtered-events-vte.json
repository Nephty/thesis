I've painted you a picture about its likely reasons.\n\n---\n\nYou mentioned some aspects where Ghostty is better. I haven't tried that terminal yet (haven't actually even heard of it), but allow me please to blindly guess that there are likely a similar amount of features that VTE has but Ghostty doesn't, or VTE does noticeably better.\n\n---\n\nI'm glad you found another project that works great for you. I just don't understand why you want one particular project to be like another one out there. Feel free to use that other one if that's what works better for you. \"I love my Emacs, I just wish it worked like Vim\" - use Vim then! \"I love Chrome, but I'd rather it worked like Firefox\" - ... you get the point.\n\n---\n\nVTE is maintained by volunteers in their limited free time, its developers and contributors doing the best they can subject to the time and motivation that they have. Maybe other projects have more resources available, fine. If you're having a problem with GNOME not being modern enough for your needs, in particular with the context of terminals, I'm afraid you're touching much more fundamental problems than just the pure technical bits.\n\nThe following is strictly only about me personally, I have no idea how other VTE developers or more-or-less regular contributors stand on this. I used to volunteer a lot of work into this project, I no longer have the motivation to do this. However, I am available for hire (part time) for project works. I'd be more than happy to implement ligature support, in exchange for industry level financial compensation for my work. Let me know if you're interested and you can make such a deal happen.\n\nI don't know what Ghostty (or any other project) does differently, it could be that it happens to have one or more contributors who happen to have a lot of time and a lot of motivation, it could be that they are younger and more passionate than me, it could be that they have fewer family and other obligations, it could be that they have significant funding, it could be that they have developers who can afford not to worry about finances, I don't know. Different project, different conditions, different staff, different goals...\n\nThere are surely technical as well as a non-technical (human resources kind of) aspects to this story.",

Similarly for keyboard protocols, etc.\n\nWhat's needed here is not advocacy, but design first, then coding. Any work here needs to start with a design document carefully discussing all the requirements on ligatures and how they will interact with all the *other* aspects of the terminal. Referencing and discussing other terminal's implementations is necessary of course, but not a substitute to actually solve the *whole* problem.\n\nIf such a design (and then the code implementing it) manifests itself, I will certainly review it. What I won't do is copy some other terminal's half-broken implementations (be it ligatures, keyboard protocol, image protocols, etc.).",

It's to give tracks of reflection for the future of both projects.\n\nI finally tried Ghostty and I suggest authors here to take a look on how they do.\nGhostty is very closed to Ptyxis design. It is fully integrated with GTK4 / Gnome but :\n\n- it has got image protocol support (kitty image protocol), very useful with NeoVim to preview images in project\n- it supports ligatures and has the good idea to show the actual char when the cursor is over the symbol\n- it's fast and lightweight\n- it's integrable like VTE, actually, Ghostty \"integrates\" their widget in a GTK app, see https://ghostty.org/docs/about#libghostty - the library implement everything (font, rendering and terminal emulation)\n\n\nDifferences with Ptyxis (for whom are interested)\n\n- it supports full-screen + toggling window decoration\n- we can set the theme to Adwaita \"flat\", \"raised\", \"raised-border\"... and support others themes\n- we can control the padding in the terminal\n- the interface is globally the same\n\n\nI repeat: \n\nI have no grievance against all of you, against the authors, against the people I'm talking to here. I have a deep respect for the work done by the Gnome project, even if I don't agree with all the choices made (for example, the famous SSD vs CSD debate...).\n\nI'm a developer myself, and I know what it's like to have to manage thousands of lines of code for a project that doesn't please everyone.\n\nBut I'm a terminal user, because I develop on NeoVim and I believe that in 2024 a terminal should be able to offer a little more than \u201crax text monospace\u201d. And I'm an advocate of avoiding the use of \u201cnon-standard\u201d software (hence my departure from Kitty).\n\nGhostty is a fine example of what I like to see in the Linux world. And I hope with all my heart to see Gnome tools and components follow the modernity it offers.\n\nI won't insist anymore. But please understand that this is my passion and affection for Gnome project speaking.\n\nA happy new year to all.",

You open this file in an editor. The text editor sends `!=` to the terminal and _never_ sends the second `=` character because there's no room to display that.\n\nThe terminal, using Fira Code, renders a ligature that has two horizontal lines stacked on top of each other. The desired rendering would be three lines on top, as in the ligated version of `!==`, but the terminal has no chance of guessing that there's supposed to be an offscreen `=` in the file.\n\nIf you claim that showing two lines stacked on top of each other, and once the remaining `=` is scrolled in then making it three lines instead is a correct, expected behavior then we have vastly different expectation about the desired enduser experience.\n\nBut we could also look at two-letter ligatures such as `<=`. This is supposed to ligate as `\u2264`, but when partially visible would show up as `<` (or `=` if doing the same story at the left edge of the screen) rather than a `\u2264` cut in half.\n\nIn the non-ligated version it makes perfect sense to me to only see `<` instead of `<=` when the edge of the screen is reached and there's no room for the `=`. But it does not make any sense whatsoever to me to show a `<` when there's not enough room to show the desired `\u2264`. Or to show a long `=` when there's not enough room to show the desired even longer `\u2261`.\n\nMaybe we have different expectations here.",

There is absolutely nothing that fails.\n\nBoth using the same font, and I placed my cursor on the same position (in a `==` test). It's not the best example, but it shows how that works on Kitty without any problem. The same appears on WezTerm.\n\n\nSo, the correct sentence is \"it works very well in others terminals, unless the font is bad\"\n\nOne more time, when I said there are \"glitches\", that was a bad word... I mean that sometimes, in rare cases, some symbols are a bit weird. But it's for certain font that are not well-designed, not Kitty or WezTerm.\n\nFor example, the \"www\" (triple w) is, IMHO, a bad idea to be represented by Fira Code font to something else than \"www\". But, this is not a ligature problem, it's a font problem, as some unicode chars are sometimes badly designed in some fonts, especially with emojis.\n\nBut, let me correct my words, ligatures work on kitty-term and wezterm. I don't have any problem that comes from the terminal itself, using a well-designed font.",

Even without trying, I know enough about the overall architecture of terminal emulation that I know for sure that no terminal out there can implement an overall ligating experience without problems. I even proved it, gave you an example. Not even Kitty or WezTerm or anyone else can get it right because the interface between the terminal emulation and the application it hosts wasn't designed to make it possible. Kitty or WezTerm could surely implement _their part_ of the story without any problem, but that wouldn't result in a perfect enduser experience, the interface doesn't allow to fix the remaining cases.\n\n> You probably meant \"impossible to get perfect\"\n\nYes, I obviously meant that. And my motivation for implementing something that can't be made perfect or good enough (according to my subjective evaluation) is much lower than for implementing it if it could be made perfect or at least what I'd consider good enough.\n\nIt can't be perfect. We may have different ideas of what is or is not considered \"good enough\". I definitely can't imagine myself being happy with the partial solution that is possible to implement, whereas apparently you would be happy with that.\n\n> we, the users, cannot use ligatures fonts\n\nThere are a plethora of terminal emulators out there, each having their own pros and cons. Ptyxis or VTE might be worse here than some others, while hopefully better in some other aspects. There can never be a clear winner. If you're a heavy terminal user with high needs, probably you won't find a single one that fully suits all your needs. It's the nature of the game, pretty much everywhere in the world. You can freely choose which terminal to use, we won't get offended or disappointed or sad if you pick a non-VTE-based one. Pick the one you're the happiest with! Just as you're pushing us to implement ligature support, maybe you can push whichever other terminal to implement whatever you have in Ptyxis but miss in that one. We, VTE developers and occasional contributors, would love VTE to be the one of the best terminals out there, but this cannot mean unconditionally adding every feature that any terminal out there has, nor to volunteer our whole lives for this project. Compromises are made, as in every project, as in every terminal out there, and these compromises are different in each.\n\n(I, personally, have volunteered a lot of time and effort into improving VTE, and I can tell you for certain that I won't volunteer to implement ligature support, I'd much-much rather spend my free time on a bunch of other things, both inside and outside (mostly outside:)) of VTE. This is strictly about myself, I don't know how likely any of the current or future VTE developers-contributors are to implement this feature at some point, and I surely don't want to try to talk any of them out of it. Speaking of which, reminder to myself: stay out of future discussions in this thread :), let them decide when and how to continue.)\n\n> Just a precision, English is not my native language. If my answer seems to be aggressive: sorry.\n\nSame here. And don't worry, it didn't sound aggressive to me :)",

            "body": "It's interesting to me how you're talking about the \"little details\", and then later mention that ligatures in other terminals indeed come with glitches that you have to accept and you are fine with.\n\nFor me, it's exactly those \"little details\" that tell me I'd rather not have ligatures at all. Because I personally much rather prefer a consistent, glitch-free typewriter-like (i.e. non-ligating) experience rather than one that has an incomplete, inconsistent, glitchy ligature support.\n\nLigatures in terminals are, by the design of the overall architecture of terminals, impossible to get correct. Imagine you have an 80 character wide window, and open a text file in your favorite editor. In columns 80-81 of this text file there are two letters that are supposed to be connected. But the terminal is only aware of the first one, to be displayed in the last column. It, by design, cannot know what the offscreen next letter would be, therefore necessarily skips the ligature. Or, for 3 character long ligatures (as there are many of them in e.g. Fira Code) it might ligate 2 of them, maybe showing two horizontal lines stacked and crossed out for `!=` rather than three horizontal lines stacked for `!==` because it doesn't see the last `=` sign. Outright incorrect and misleading behavior. You can no longer rely on what's near the edge of the screen.\n\nOr think of those monospace fonts that came up with the utterly braindamaged idea of a single-cell \"fi\" ligature. What the heck to do there? Lay down the rest of the row 1 column off, breaking vertical alignment, or leave a space mid-word to compensate for that?\n\nGo through the ligature related bugs of Monaspace. There are plenty, plenty of inconsistencies that just cannot be fixed due to the nature of the game. In my eyes it's a disaster.\n\nAnd then combine this with the aforementioned technical details that make this feature, well at least to the extent it's implementable at all, really not easy or straightforward to implement as there simply isn't a library that we could just pull in that would do this for us, there is no library out there that applies ligatures and yet guarantees to keep aligned to columns as desired. Basically a font rendering engine would have to be written from scratch. Or give up guaranteeing the columns, which would bring in its own additional pile of \"glitches\".\n\nI find it weird how someone is happy with a necessarily monospace world, yet wants ligatures in that. For me personally, ligatures is pointless in the monospace world. Ligatures is about making the rendering truly beautiful, but in a monospace world you can't do anything to make it beautiful, it's a heavily compromised world in terms of beauty to begin with. In my opinion, in order to achieve full visual beauty we would have to redesign terminal emulation from scratch in a way that allows proportional fonts. And then allows cursor positioning or overwriting parts of an existing text in terms of logical character position rather than visual. And allows cursor movement, text operations regardless of where the line happened to visually wrap to the next row. Many-many things (including ligatures) would become much easier in that world. Alas, given how ~50 years of work has been built up on the concept of a strict grid of characters, this is unlikely to happen. Anyway, I digress, and YMMV.\n\n---\n\nAll these being said, if someone comes up with a reasonably clean, maintainable, optional (i.e. possible to enable or disable via API), and reasonably good (within the possibilities of this world) ligature implementation in VTE, I have high hopes that the main developer would accept it. I would definitely not mind it landing in VTE.\n\nThe project is running on extremely limited developer resources (as already mentioned), and apparently putting quite a lot of work into a necessarily limited, inconsistent, glitchy ligature experience is just not at the top of our todo lists.",

However, I do wonder if anyone here is considering this request.\n\nIt's obvious that supporting ligature fonts is not a priority, and I understand that. But it's these little details that make us use other terminal emulators, instead of the one implemented in the official version of Gnome. I'm obviously talking about Ptyxis, which I find superb, but which is sorely lacking in more complete support for \u201cmodern\u201d things like ligature support (or images, smooth scrolls, and so on).\n\nI read the comments and I'm surprised by the questions that come up, like here https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/192#note_647289.\n\nWezTerm, or even Kitty, don't seem to have that many problems handling it (at least from what I see in the sources), and I think it's not crazy to say that the person who chooses to use a ligature font will have to accept certain \u201cglitches\u201d (I've had some on Kitty, without it being a real issue).\n\nIn short, there are certain aspects I don't understand, I'm aware of that, but the management of ligature fonts is still a point that would make VTE really cool.",

Now you'll have to not just put a small patch to a branch but also backport this untestable CI ?\n\nAnyway, I will try to play a bit with this in time to get it working for 0.80, hopefully.",

They'll almost certainly come across the OSC 9 numbers 1=normal, 2=error etc.\n\nOver here VTE was strongly discouraged against coming up with a competing (non-OSC-9) solution, and it indeed didn't; presumably others won't either. That is, our internal concept is necessarily strongly tied to OSC 9 and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future or to be extended to accommodate competing solutions as well.\n\nEven if there's a slight difference between the termprops API and OSC 9 due to its design (0=off isn't a numerical value in termprops but the lack of the property, if I understand correctly) I see no benefit in forcing our termprops API users to use symbolic constants, and confusing them in case they'd rather go with the numbers that they might already be familiar with.\n\n> I don't think they need to match\n\nMy opinion is rather: I don't think they should deviate, unless there's a strong reason (which I can't see here).\n\nAnyway, this is just my 2 cents. The current solution is not wrong per se, we just have different opinions in this \"why? why not?\" question.",

In `vteseq`, the handler of the screen switching escape sequences always does an `invalidate_all()`. An additional invalidation, or lack thereof, due to a semantically incorrect comparison, doesn't make a difference.\n\nHowever, there's at least one subtle difference that I could fine. Restarting the blinking of the cursor depends on this semantically incorrect comparison.\n\nOpen a new terminal, the cursor is in the top row (let's assume a one-line shell prompt). From a different terminal do a `sleep 15; printf '\\e[?1047h' >/dev/pts/N` and then quickly switch back to this terminal. The cursor's blinking stops in 10 seconds, and after another 5 seconds (when switching to the alternate screen) it doesn't restart. Repeat with `l` to switch back to normal screen, it still doesn't restart. Again with `h` to switch to the alternate screen whose `insert_delta` is 1 now instead of 0 (don't ask why) and suddenly the internal representation of the row isn't the same across the two screens, hence blinking is restarted.\n\nAnd my patch above doesn't fix it either because I'm still performing this semantically invalid comparison :-) Similarly, calling `invalidate_row(row)` is harmless but semantically incorrect after a screen switch because `row` is relative to a different number than expected.",

Or we could use a brace-block to make `context` go out of scope there.\n\nThere are a few other places as well where the code could look slightly different, e.g. rename `finalize()` to `flush()`, or to `flush_and_reinitialize()` and thus make it automatically call `initialize()` again, these are minor details; let me know if you're okay with the overall approach but would prefer any such minor tweaks.\n\nI've just barely tested the patch with the reproducers shown above; it needs more heavy testing to make sure nothing breaks (e.g. invalidation rectangle tracking). Aiming for `master` only; if a backport is desired then IMHO that should be the one-line \"quick and dirty fix\".",

            "body": "A quick and dirty fix is\n\n```\n                 update_insert_delta();\n-                if (m_scroll_on_output || context.m_bottom) {\n+                if (m_scroll_on_output || context.m_bottom || m_screen == &m_alternate_screen) {\n                         scroll_to_bottom();\n                 }\n```\n\nLooks like we never snap the alternate screen's scroll position to its desired place. The only thing we have is this piece of code here responsible for auto-following, that is, if we were snapped to the bottom previously then we keep it snapped to the bottom (regardless of the \"scroll on output\" setting). This, combined with the user not being able to scroll away, is supposed to guarantee that once snapped to the bottom (as initially the alternate screen is) it'll always remain this way.\n\nExcept that it goes wrong if the previous state was checked on the normal screen.\n\n---\n\nThere are probably some other obscure inconsistencies as well. My theory is that you can probably do this (haven't tried) with some wait between the steps except where noted:\n\n- produce more than a screenful of text\n- disable scroll-on-output\n- scroll back\n- switch to alternate screen\n- enable scroll-on-output\n- in a single step:\n  - switch to normal screen\n  - produce some output\n  - switch to alternate screen\n- disable scroll-on-output\n- switch to normal screen\n\nand you would notice not being scrolled to the bottom, although it should (and would if we inserted some pause even where we didn't). That's simply because the snapping logic doesn't notice the quick back-and-forth switch to the normal screen where data was emitted.\n\n---\n\nDigging a bit deeper:\n\nNot sure if other aspects that we track in `ProcessingContext`, e.g. bounding box tracking, also potentially suffer from similar issues.\n\nThe overall approach is at least semantically incorrect, as code segments like `if ([...] (context.m_saved_cursor.row != m_screen->cursor.row))` might compare the old screen's cursor row (relative to its origin) against the new screen's cursor row (relative to its different origin). I suspect it might happen that the cursor moves to a different visual row but its numerical representation happens to stay the same, and as a result it's not repainted.\n\nI guess this line in `post_CMD()` is super relevant:\n\n    // FIXME m_terminal->m_screen may be != m_saved_screen, check for that!\n\nI guess upon a screen switch we should \"flush\" the knowledge we gather up and re-initialize the state. I think it would go something like this:\n\nMost of the current constrcutor of `ProcessingContext` would be moved to a normal \"initializer\" method, only setting `m_terminal` would remain in the construtcor. The constructor would of course call this initializer method.\n\nMost of what we do in the bottom of `process_incoming()` would go to a normal \"finalizer\" method of `ProcessingContext`. The destructor would also call this.\n\nThe FIXME line would be replaced by calling the \"finalizer\" and the \"initializer\" methods if the screen switched, effectively flushing every todo we gathered up so far and starting anew.",

One possible way to implement that would be to make `VteScreen` abstract, and derive `VteNormalScreen` and `VteAlternateScreen`. Or is it overkill? @chpe what do you think?",

I'm not sure what's going on.\n\nAnyway, should be an easy fix (hopefully), I'll look into this tonight or tomorrow (unless chpe feels like beating me :))\n\nJust wondering: when leaving the alternate screen, should we restore the previous scrollbar position or is it okay to just simply scroll to the bottom?",

I've changed it a bit since the last wip/progress branch; please check and test if this still meets the requirements. The parser at least should fully copy conemu behaviour.",

            "body": "FYI, I'm fairly certain the win32-input-mode protocol doesn't need more than 16-bit parameter values. It's a direct mapping of the [`KEY_EVENT_RECORD`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/key-event-record-str) structure, which only uses `WORD` values (the `dwControlKeyState` is a 32-bit `DWORD`, but I think only 9 bits are used). And Windows Terminal itself only supports 16-bit parameter values, and it needs to parse this protocol itself.\n\nFor characters outside the BMP, Windows generates two \"virtual\" key presses with the surrogate pair codepoints. In that situation the virtual key codes and scan codes would be 0.\n\nETA: Thinking about this some more, if you actually had a keyboard that generated supplementary characters, it's possible you would get non-zero vk codes and scan codes for those surrogate pair characters, but I've only ever seen them generated via something like an IME, and in that scenario the key codes have always been zero. Not that this is relevant to the 16-bit issue - I just don't want to be misleading anyone about the other protocol details.",

            "id": 2285645,
            "type": "DiscussionNote",
            "body": "The first obstacle I see in implementing advanced keyboard protocols is that a GTK keyboard input event does not provide sufficient information to support protocols like kitty or, say, win32-input-mode ([spec](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/doc/specs/%234999%20-%20Improved%20keyboard%20handling%20in%20Conpty.md)). The win32-input-mode protocol, in my view, is relatively simple to implement yet powerful enough (e.g., it allows distinguishing between the right and left Control keys, something the kitty protocol cannot do). Therefore, I decided to start with it. I'll explain using this protocol as an example.\n\nThis is the structure of the ESC sequence for a win32-input-mode event:\n```\n^[ [ Vk ; Sc ; Uc ; Kd ; Cs ; Rc _\n```\n\nVk: the value of wVirtualKeyCode \u2014 any number. If omitted, defaults to '0'.\n\nSc: the value of wVirtualScanCode \u2014 any number. If omitted, defaults to '0'.\n\nUc: the decimal value of UnicodeChar \u2014 for example, NUL is \"0\", LF is \"10\", the character 'A' is \"65\". If omitted, defaults to '0'.\n\nKd: the value of bKeyDown \u2014 either a '0' or '1'. If omitted, defaults to '0'.\n\nCs: the value of dwControlKeyState \u2014 any number. If omitted, defaults to '0'.\n\nRc: the value of wRepeatCount \u2014 any number. If omitted, defaults to '1'.\n\nAs we can see, the fields correspond to the KEY_EVENT_RECORD structure, which you can easily find in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/key-event-record-str).\n\nThe wVirtualScanCode is not a critically important parameter. Application developers generally do not use it, preferring the more portable wVirtualKeyCode instead. However, wVirtualScanCode is still necessary for distinguishing between the left and right Shift keys.\n\nAccordingly, our interest lies in determining the correct value for [wVirtualKeyCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes). This is where we encounter a problem: the Keyval value in a GTK event is tied to the current keyboard layout, whereas the wVirtualKeyCode is not. For a key with the Latin letter \"A,\" wVirtualKeyCode will always equal 65 (0x41), even if the current layout is Russian, where this key generates the letter \"\u0424.\"\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the xkbcommon library (it works with both X11 and Wayland). With its help, we can determine which character the given key would generate in the Latin layout by using the hardware key code field of the GTK event.\n\nI want to note that knowing the Latin character corresponding to the current key, independent of the current layout, is also necessary for a full implementation of the extended terminal keyboard input protocol for kitty.\n\nHere is a sample application demonstrating how this can be done. Here is the code:\n```\n#include <gtk/gtk.h>\n#include <xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h>\n\n// Structure for storing xkb state\ntypedef struct {\n    struct xkb_context *context;\n    struct xkb_keymap *keymap;\n    struct xkb_state *state_english; // State for the English layout\n} XkbData;\n\n// Function for handling keyboard events\nstatic gboolean on_key_event(GtkWidget *widget, GdkEventKey *event, gpointer data) {\n    XkbData *xkb_data = (XkbData *)data;\n    GtkTextBuffer *buffer = GTK_TEXT_BUFFER(g_object_get_data(G_OBJECT(widget), \"buffer\"));\n\n    const char *event_type = (event->type == GDK_KEY_PRESS) ? \"Key Press\" : \"Key Release\";\n\n    xkb_state_update_key(xkb_data->state_english, event->hardware_keycode, \n        (event->type == GDK_KEY_PRESS) ? XKB_KEY_DOWN : XKB_KEY_UP);\n\n    // Get the key symbol\n    xkb_keysym_t keysym = xkb_state_key_get_one_sym(xkb_data->state_english, event->hardware_keycode);\n\n    // Get the symbol name\n    char keysym_name[64];\n    xkb_keysym_get_name(keysym, keysym_name, sizeof(keysym_name));\n\n    // Get modifiers\n    xkb_mod_mask_t mods = xkb_state_serialize_mods(xkb_data->state_english, XKB_STATE_MODS_DEPRESSED);\n\n    // Get the key symbol for the English layout\n    char text_english[64] = {0};\n    xkb_state_key_get_utf8(xkb_data->state_english, event->hardware_keycode, text_english, sizeof(text_english));\n\n    // Form the message\n\n    gchar *message = g_strdup_printf(\n        \"Event: %s\\nKeyval: %u (%s, %lc)\\nHardware Keycode: %u\\nGroup: %u\\nModifiers: %u\\nXKB Keysym: %s\\nXKB text eng: %s\\nXKB mods: %u\\n\\n\",\n        // XKB text cur: %s\\n\n        event_type,\n        event->keyval,\n        gdk_keyval_name(event->keyval),\n        gdk_keyval_to_unicode(event->keyval),\n        event->hardware_keycode,\n        event->group,\n        event->state,\n        keysym_name[0] ? keysym_name : \"Unknown\",\n        text_english[0] ? text_english : \"None\",\n        mods\n    );\n\n    // Add text to the buffer\n    GtkTextIter end;\n    gtk_text_buffer_get_end_iter(buffer, &end);\n    gtk_text_buffer_insert(buffer, &end, message, -1);\n\n    g_free(message);\n    return FALSE; // Continue processing other handlers\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);\n\n    // Initialize xkb\n    XkbData xkb_data = {0};\n    xkb_data.context = xkb_context_new(XKB_CONTEXT_NO_FLAGS);\n    if (!xkb_data.context) {\n        g_error(\"Failed to create XKB context\");\n    }\n\n    // Load the current keyboard layout\n    struct xkb_rule_names names = {0}; // Use system settings\n    xkb_data.keymap = xkb_keymap_new_from_names(xkb_data.context, &names, XKB_KEYMAP_COMPILE_NO_FLAGS);\n    if (!xkb_data.keymap) {\n        g_error(\"Failed to create XKB keymap\");\n    }\n\n    // Create state for the English layout\n    struct xkb_rule_names english_names = { .layout = \"us\" }; // Specify English layout\n    struct xkb_keymap *english_keymap = xkb_keymap_new_from_names(xkb_data.context, &english_names, XKB_KEYMAP_COMPILE_NO_FLAGS);\n    if (!english_keymap) {\n        g_error(\"Failed to create XKB English keymap\");\n    }\n    xkb_data.state_english = xkb_state_new(english_keymap);\n    xkb_keymap_unref(english_keymap);\n\n    // Create main window\n    GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);\n    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), \"Keyboard Event Viewer (Dual Layouts)\");\n    gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 600, 400);\n\n    // Create text view\n    GtkWidget *text_view = gtk_text_view_new();\n    gtk_text_view_set_editable(GTK_TEXT_VIEW(text_view), FALSE);\n    GtkTextBuffer *buffer = gtk_text_view_get_buffer(GTK_TEXT_VIEW(text_view));\n    g_object_set_data(G_OBJECT(window), \"buffer\", buffer);\n\n    // Add text view to scroll window\n    GtkWidget *scrolled_window = gtk_scrolled_window_new(NULL, NULL);\n    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(scrolled_window), text_view);\n\n    // Pack everything into the window\n    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), scrolled_window);\n\n    // Connect signals\n    g_signal_connect(window, \"destroy\", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);\n    g_signal_connect(window, \"key-press-event\", G_CALLBACK(on_key_event), &xkb_data);\n    g_signal_connect(window, \"key-release-event\", G_CALLBACK(on_key_event), &xkb_data);\n\n    // Show the window\n    gtk_widget_show_all(window);\n\n    gtk_main();\n\n    // Free resources\n    xkb_state_unref(xkb_data.state_english);\n    xkb_keymap_unref(xkb_data.keymap);\n    xkb_context_unref(xkb_data.context);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd here is the build command:\n```\ngcc -o key_press ./key_press.c  `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0 xkbcommon`\n```",

A year after this discussion, in Matrix spec v1.10, the `<font>` tag with `color`, `data-mx-bg-color`, and `data-mx-color` attributes was deprecated... in favor of a `<span>` tag with `data-mx-bg-color` and `data-mx-color` attributes. (You can see the updated spec at @Mis012's link, above.)\n\nSo, they're no longer even trying to pretend that Matrix formatting is HTML-compatible, and keeping the `<font>` tag around for Matrix compatibility is no longer a particularly solid argument.",

I'm sorry my wording was misleading, but I was looking at it from the point of view of someone trying to emulate ConEmu's behavior exactly as it appears, because that's what we were doing in Windows Terminal. If you're using a different representation for those error states then that minimal value quirk does seems pointless.\n\n> The unfortunate inconsistency with `9;4;2` and `9;4;4`'s last parameter being interpreted conceptually differently if it's `0` versus `1`..`100` still remains.\n\nYeah. Personally I think this aspect of the ConEmu behavior is worth matching, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if you chose to ignore it. I'm willing to bet there are other implementations of `OSC 9;4` that have got this wrong the same way we did in the initial WT implementation.",

(Still, arguably it should be the Taskbar implementing it and not ConEmu/WT, but that's not my problem.)\n\n> `9;4;2` [...] and `9;4;4` [...] if the active value was zero it uses a minimal value\n\nI guess this was a bit sloppy wording on your side, wasn't it? The old active value doesn't matter, and it's not only `0` for the new value that undergoes this restriction. A minimal value of 10% is always enforced in these two major states (\"error\" and \"paused\"), no matter how you got there. Correct? But, again, it's Windows only, we don't have to (and IMO shouldn't) care about it.\n\n---\n\nThe unfortunate inconsistency with `9;4;2` and `9;4;4`'s last parameter being interpreted conceptually differently if it's `0` versus `1`..`100` still remains. I guess we have to live with it, any change in behavior would likely cause _some_ apps to misbehave.",

It's the taskbar making the decision to use different colors for the bar; it could just as well decide to use some icon for error/paused, or have a thin frame of the desired color around the yet-to-be-occupied part of the progress bar, etc. If it chooses a UI that cannot (or can hardly) differentiate between x% normal and x% error for small values of x, I guess it might be somewhat reasonable (although is surely questionalbe, might be misleading as well) to depict 10% error as a workaround. And then it's done equally for every app: terminal or not.\n\nOr is it in the emulation part? If there was a way to query the value (there'll be in VTE if we use termprops), would it report 10? If there was a way to switch back to \"normal\" state without changing the percentage, would it remain on 10?

Even when macOS's version was 11.0 or 10.15 or even lower.\n\nTherefore I presume that you would also have success with building a somewhat older VTE.\n\nGenerally, we tend to aim for a roughly maybe around 1-2 year gap between VTE's version and the underlying system's version, but there have been exceptions (if it was justified) when the gap was much smaller (e.g. if I remember correctly, VTE 0.76 required a GTK version released at the same time).\n\nmacOS 13.3 was released a bit over 1.5 years ago.\n\nIt's not a project goal to support older systems, older VTE versions can always do that. For newer VTE versions the focus is on new features, code cleanliness, improved performance etc., sacrificing compatibility with older systems if that's what it takes.\n\nIf you ran into a compiler error, at least please show us what that error was. If compilation was explicitly rejected due to your system being old then probably there was a good reason for that. Nevertheless, if there's an easy and non-intrusive fix to support older systems then a patch would probably be accepted.",

I think the reason for this is because you've got a change of state that the user needs to be aware of (something has failed, or is paused awaiting user input). These states are indicated by a different color in the Windows taskbar (red for 2, and yellow for 4), but you wouldn't see that color change if the progress is still at 0. Thus the need for a minimal value.\n\n> If the progress bar is expected never to retract (which is not necessarily true for all the progress bars out there in the world) then it would have been equivalent and much simpler to just always set the given value.\n\nI don't necessarily disagree, but we actually got a bug report from some application that was dependent on this behavior, because we originally didn't realise it was supposed to work this way. It's definitely something people are using.\n\n> Or am I overthinking???\n\nYeah, I think you are. It's an existing sequence that's been around for over a decade. People have been happily using it all this time, flaws and all. If you're so disgusted by the implementation that you can't bear to have in included in VTE, you could always invent your own sequence, but nobody is going to thank you for making them support two different sequences for the same thing.",

            "body": "If I'm not mistaken, the relevant code for this is not the parser, as linked by chpe, but that `DoSetProgress()` eventually ending up at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/740b09c363cb16fbb730d72c53eaca1c530a016e/src/ConEmu/RealConsole.cpp#L13656 .\n\n(Note how the enum description at the top is incorrect or outdated, revealing that state `4` was probably a later addition.)\n\nIndeed, state `0` forces the percentage value to be 0, state `1` sets the new number (if omitted then 0, this was handled in the parser).\n\nState `3` always ignores the additional parameter (or lack thereof) and leaves the value unchanged. (This mode is for a \"spinning wheel\" to denote progress when we have no clue about the percentage.)\n\n> `9;4;2` [...] and `9;4;4` [...] if the active value was zero it uses a minimal value\n\nI don't understand that. What is that \"minimal value\" (both the concept and the actual value)?\n\nWhat I see, by reading (possibly mis-reading) the code, is: First, if the value is omitted then the parser handles it as if it was zero, so there's no way to distinguish these two cases further down the line. Then if the value is larger than 0 then it's set as the new value; if the value is 0 (or omitted) then the old value stays in place. There's no special-casing for when the old value was 0, there is special-casing for when the new number is 0.\n\n---\n\nSide note:\n\nI can't help but notice how bad the design is for the omitted/zero value at states `2` and `4`. It's semantically a nonsense; it's hard to use correctly and easy to use incorrectly.\n\nIf the progress bar is expected never to retract (which is not necessarily true for all the progress bars out there in the world) then it would have been equivalent and much simpler to just always set the given value. After all, it's one single application controlling the progress bar, it knows its percentage, being able to leave it unchanged across a state change (rather than having to re-specify the same value) is not a needed feature.\n\nIf the progress bar can retract (as the app gets more info and notices that it underestimated the remaining amount, or if interactively more tasks are added to the queue) then you can't jump back from \"1%\" to \"0%\" and go into \"error\" or \"paused\" state in a single step, it has to be two consecutive steps; although you could have done it in a single step from \"2%\" to \"1%\" or any other higher values. Very easy to write incorrect code that almost always works correctly, except at those very small numbers. The correct code either requires branching on the actual values (a sign of bad design: who on Earth would want to do that?); or has to take the code path which works with all numbers, i.e. to set the new value first and then in a separate step switch to the \"error\" state, in which case the dual behavior (the actual behavior depending on the concrete number) of the design is pointless.\n\nIt's a \"feature\" which is tempting to be used, but whenever used, is almost certainly used incorrectly. It's a \"feature\" which any reasonably simple implementation of the fully correct behavior necessarily has to avoid. It's an absolutely pointless and harmful complication on what could (and should) have been simpler and better.\n\n---\n\nSpeaking of design, one more dilemma:\n\nWhat is supposed to happen if the operation is complete? What do existing apps that use this feature do? What is systemd about to do?\n\nI guess the main use case is when the given terminal is not in the foreground, so that in its tab / title / the taskbar etc. I still get to see how it's going. But what should happen if the operation is done?\n\nThe app immediately removing (resetting) the progress bar would remove it from the UI, I guess. It would not draw my attention to something that's been completed and is ready to take new input from me. It's okay if the use case is that I simply want to make sure that there's no pending operation (e.g. it's safe to suspend the laptop, all files have been uploaded or whatever), but not if I want to follow up with further steps.\n\nSo I guess the app would have to keep it at 100% until... until what? Until the next user interaction, I guess?\n\nWouldn't it be desireable to have a \"ready\" state which the UI can display in a completely different way, e.g. with a green tick?\n\nOr is the numeric value of 100 that's supposed to behave this way? Therefore I guess it's part of the design that the emitter app is supposed to round all percentage values downwards, rather than to the nearest integer? Is it documented anywhere? Or is it supposed to be common knowledge about progress bars?\n\nBut wait... if it's an interactive app that completed an interactively given command then it could surely do this. But if it's a simple command that exits after completion? It has to clean up after itself, so the only reasonable thing to do is to remove the progress bar. So, should maybe the terminal decide to keep the progress bar visible at least until you focus that terminal? Should interactive apps therefore also follow this pattern and remove the progress bar as soon as it's completed? If so, does it or does it not make a difference if they skip the value of 100%? Or, if it's supposed to be removed immediately, what's the point of the value 100?\n\nOr should utilities that exit after completing their task leave the progress bar active? Should the terminal perhaps offer some means of dismissing it (e.g. by clicking on it)?\n\n(Mind you, I haven't yet checked the behavior of ConEmu or Windows Terminal, nor any utility using this feature.)\n\n---\n\nIs there anywhere a sort of a design doc, big picture doc, a \"this is how you're supposed to use this feature\" document?\n\nIs there anywhere a doc that goes down into all these details that I'm nitpicking?\n\nOr am I overthinking???",

If their behavior differs from the Windows Terminal implementation, that should be considered a bug on our part.",

According to the description on this page, a fourth (ignored, possibly empty I guess?? or does it have to be number??) parameter is nevertheless _required_. Even if you want to remove the progress bar, the grammar here tells that it has to be `9;4;0;` with that trailing semicolon.\n\nThen back to the ConEmu doc which says the syntax is `ESC ] 9 ; 4 ; st ; pr ST` whereas sometimes `pr` is optional; does it allow or not the removal of its preceding semicolon? Not entirely clear from the doc.\n\nAnd then we're yet to check the actual implementations.",

I guess it's up to the UI) at `x` percent.\n\nThe third digit can also be `2` (\"error\"), `3` (\"indeterminate\"), `4` (sometimes \"paused\", sometimes \"warning\" -- which??). It's unclear to me whether they are mutually exclusive to `1`, i.e. remove the progress bar and display something else instead; or whether they set some additional state (and in that case how to remove that additional state while preserving the progress). `2` and `4` can take an optional parameter, unclear to me what its meaning is.\n\nWhereas a progress bar, without any additional semantics, is a concept seen at many places and thus I find it a nice idea to add to terminal emulators, I can't see the justification of the additional modes. They seem to be way too specific, unclear to me why every app out there who needs a progress bar would be happy with this set of additional states. Also unclear to me why any such additional state have to be associated with a progress bar; why couldn't someone who has no progress bar notify about an error or warning or paused state?\n\nI'm personally not happy with the choice of using a percent value. Given today's UIs, screens etc. it might be desireable to draw a much smoother bar, if information is available to the emitter app. The UI could e.g. round the visual description to \"[integer]%\" but keep the actual bar move in more fine-grained steps. But that's what we have, I guess.\n\nThere's quite some confusion around as the choice of OSC 9 conflicts with some other terminals, I guess I've seen Kitty and iTerm2 mentioned who do notification or something similar. I don't know how these were resolved, or whether we'd be okay to jump on the WT and systemd wagon here.",

This control is processed by placing a reverse question mark in the display at the active position. Most existing terminals (VT100, VT101, VT102, VT125, VT131, VT132) display the blotch character instead of the reversed question mark.\n\nThe other interesting one is `CAN`, which was originally treated as an alias for `SUB` on some of the earlier VT terminals, but was later changed to display nothing - it just serves to cancel a control sequence. Quoting STD 070, p5-129:\n\n> If received during an escape or control sequence, the sequence \nis immediately terminated and not executed. No character is displayed.",

A brief (possibly much shorter than the UI refresh cycle) back-and-forth change of a character cell, if requested by an application like `dnf`, may or may not end up being shown on the display. While it might happen that you see frequent flickers in VTE and have not yet seen any in Konsole, it just means their internal timings of processing the data is different and the bug is much less likely (but not impossible at all) to surface in Konsole. But it does not mean that VTE is buggy by any means. You could test many more terminal emulators and find flickering in quite a few of them. And you could easily find a plethora of utilities that can update their UI in VTE without flickering.\n\nPlease report to `dnf` developers that they shouldn't even momentarily erase the contents that they are about re-populate with near-identical data, they should just overwrite the old data in place.",

Every terminal emulator produces this same behavior.\n\nThe job of a terminal emulator is to execute the instructions it receives. In your example, it executes those instructions precisely. Due to a weird interaction between dnf5 (its output not ending in a newline) and your shell (expecting that the previous command's output ended in a newline), the behavior they together request for is this behavior that you see, a behavior that doesn't make sense.\n\nThe bug is there, not with the terminal emulator.\n\nDespite that, I showed you multiple different ways to fix the scenario. This goes beyond what's expected here, because this is not a user support forum but a bugtracker, and the bug is elsewhere.\n\n---\n\nThis is not the first time I'm mentioning it, but let me mention it again please.\n\nWith all due respect:\n\nWe have severe communication issues.\n\nYour English is very poor, in my opinion not sufficient to drive a conversation without misunderstanding each other all the time. (I'm not a native or fluent English speaker either. Maybe someone who is fluent has a better chance of decoding what you say.)\n\nI don't understand you. I am trying very hard to make sense of what you write, sometimes I think I can (but maybe I misunderstand you), sometimes I cannot.\n\nI still don't understand why in one of the examples two of your prompts was `$` and the third one was `(...):~$`. Despite you trying to explain it, I still don't understand.\n\n> That is so, indeed, however for your convenience, this, anyone would be able to discover for themselves.\n\nI literally don't understand this sentence, either. Do you ask how could anyone reasonably discover this themselves? In my opinion it's a pretty obvious idea. Maybe I'm wrong.\n\nI don't understand what you mean by me becoming a magician.\n\nI hardly understand anything that you say.\n\nAnd clearly you don't understand my responses either.\n\nPlease, please, very please, find someone who helps you express your thoughts in English and helps you interpret our responses. (I think online translation services (Google, Bing etc.) from your native tongue would already do a much better job.) (Also: please translate back your comments with one of these services to your native tongue and see if you understand.)\n\nOr, especially if it's proven to you that you filed the bug to the wrong component because the issue is not with the terminal emulators, therefore this is not the right forum to continue the discussion and ask for help; may I kindly recommend to use a technical support forum in your own native language?\n\nThank you for your understanding!",

With this stupid example, it's probably your approach. Give me a few days to think about actual potential real life scenarios.\n\nI think we should go essentially with the approach that results in the better user experience. However, if we can't find any actual use cases that strongly weigh for one behavior or the other then it's truly reasonable to for the one that's simpler to implement.\n\nI.e. at this moment I think your idea is the winner one, but give me some time to think it through :)",

The issue is not specific to VTE, you'd see the same in other unrelated terminals as well.\n\nIf the output of a utility doesn't end in a newline, it messes up the subsequent prompt and command line in `bash`. This is a well-known issue with `bash`, with probably no reliable and cross-terminal solution that `bash` could use out of the box as workaround.\n\nPreferably, specify an output format to `dnf` (or whichever other utility) that ends in a newline.\n\nIf a command has already been run and the new prompt doesn't start in column 1, you can just get used to pressing Enter to get a new prompt.\n\nVTE beginning with version 0.76 (and a few other terminals out there) supports the unofficial \"conditional newline\" escape sequence which is `\\e]133;L\\e\\\\`. Emit this from the beginning of your prompt: it's a newline if the cursor is not at the beginning of a line (more precisely: beginning of a possibly auto-wrapped multi-line \"paragraph\"), and a no-op otherwise. Embed it between `\\[` and `\\]` for `bash` to correctly compute the columns, as it's required by `bash`. See `/etc/profile.d/vte.sh` (or whichever similar filename that your distro ships it with) for a commented-out example, you can simply uncomment that one line (and make sure that your distro is set up to `source` this file from your interactive shells) if you'd prefer this behavior.",

We really need a solution for regex matching to only be performed on the extracted contiguous runs of non-OSC-8 cells.\n\nFor this, the above patch might be a good starting point, in order not to have to reimplement (duplicate) a slight variant `get_text()` from scratch, nor to have to do the painful matching between the string and the attributes array. But then regex matching will have to manually split this string at `\\0`s and run individually for each component.\n****",

At least I'm almost certain about it. After all, they are now mutually exclusive, they no longer can have any effect on each other.",

I think a generic text extracting method, and some follow-up quirks would generally be nicer. But we already have flags about whitespace preserving. Also the external follow-up tweaking, based on a deprecated array of a very few attributes (only including the basic colors and maybe two arrbites out of the many, definitely not the hyperlink), and having to match the offsets between the strings vs. the attributes array sounds truly painful.\n\nThe magic trick of replacing hyperlink cells with `\\0` bytes guarantees that the preceding and following segments aren't glued together to a false positive. That '\\0' in the middle of the string isn't mistakenly taken as the end of the string, onscreen hyperlinks are still detected fine even if they're followed by an explicit OSC 8 hyperlink in the given row.",

We're talking about code as simple as \"at the very beginning of the method that paints the cursor: if the cursor is set to be hidden then return\". How could this go wrong?? Any such bug would be hard to introduce, and we'd surely have received reports about permanent incorrect behavior then, not just transient flickers.\n\nPlease trust that VTE is doing what it needs to do.\n\nI'm sorry but I won't get involved in debugging `ollama`, `lips`, `node.js` or any other similar software, let alone work-in-progress modifications of them. It's up to you, or the developers of those software to figure it out.",

            "body": "Unfortunately it's not possible to make the cursor entirely flicker-free.\n\nThe cursor traverses through all the characters that are re-printed (except for certain clearing and scrolling sequences), and if for whatever reason a UI update occurs in the middle, the cursor is not at its expected location.\n\nHiding and re-showing the cursor, a trick also seen in `ollama`'s output, mitigates it to some extent: it won't flash up at places it's not expected to, but it still might briefly disappear at its desired location. With command line prompts it's hardly ever noticeable, since operations that change the contents but leave the cursor at place are not typical at all.\n\nFor a progress bar, as in `ollama`, a 100% robust solution can be to completely hide the cursor for the entire duration of those progress bars. After all, you don't need a cursor then. Just make sure that if the application ends abruptly, e.g. via Ctrl+C or some other signal, then it quickly re-enables the cursor before quitting. For a prompt, like in your `lips` REPL, this is obviously not feasible: you need to show the cursor since it acts as the input cursor.\n\nEmitting the change in an atomic step surely reduces the chance of a final flicker, as per my previous comment. If you're lucky enough that no-one splits that single write later into several smaller data fragments and the terminal also handles it as one, then it won't flicker. The more extra hops you have in the middle, like networking, ssh etc., each might add their own chance of splitting into two or more consecutive smaller blocks, thus slightly increasing the risk of a tiny flicker.\n\n---\n\nI can think of a few more cases when a flicker is unavoidable.\n\nOne is combining characters (like non-spacing combining marks (NFD accents), spacing combining marks, VS16 emoji selector etc.). Here receiving the base character first, followed by the combining or emoji selecting character slightly later, might cause the first one on its own to be rendered momentarily. For this, I blame Unicode's design for placing the combining accents after the base character rather than before.\n\nClosely related is ligatures (not supported by VTE) and Arabic shaping: The first character(s) might briefly be displayed in their non-ligated or non-properly-ligated / non-properly-shaped form.\n\nA completely different one is BiDi: on top of the regular emulation behavior there's a layer that visually shuffles around the characters. Here all sorts of completely different shuffling can happen with partial data.\n\n---\n\nAt one point there was a proposal for an escape sequence for atomic (flicker-free) updates. I don't think there was an agreement how it should look like, and I don't know if anyone went ahead and implemented anything. But it's still just a hint, it can't be a mandated escape sequence; if the closing counterpart is lost for whatever reason then the terminal would never update anything, that's not good. The goal was to be a hint for the terminal to wait for a little bit longer before updating the UI. But, again, I don't know if any terminal added support for something like this.\n\n---\n\nFor your use case, combining accents and BiDi probably don't matter. The best is to combine both methods that you asked about previously: fix the escape sequences so that the basic text content is guaranteed to be flicker-free even if the data is replayed slowly, and aim for an atomic write of the entire update so that the cursor's flickering is also much less likely. Also combine with hiding and showing the cursor if you wish to.\n\nThis is about as far as you can get with avoiding flickers, and it should be pretty good in practice.",

Please (if you're attempting to fix this bug) let this be your primary goal.\n\nThe stream should, with a tiny delay inserted at any point, still produce flicker-free output. (Note: there's a `slowcat` utility in VTE's source which can insert a tiny delay after every byte, should you wish to experiment with slow playbacks.)\n\n---\n\nWhat's the problem with \"printing everything at once\", if that \"everything\" contains clearing the line and then reprinting it?\n\n---\n\nFirst, before the data actually leaves the application:\n\nHow do you know that it really prints everything at once, i.e. atomically??\n\nYour best bet is to use low-level functions such as `write()`. Theoretically it can result in a short write, in which case you have to retry with the remaining bits, and thus it's no longer atomic. [Update: now that I think of it, I think it can only happen in non-blocking mode which you're unlikely to have enabled. [Update 2: I was wrong, short writes can also happen in the default blocking mode if the output channel is clogged and a signal arrives.]] In practice, since you only write small amounts of data into the tty channel and the terminal emulator keeps draining it, you are pretty safe.\n\nOr maybe you use higher level stdio functions, such as `[f]printf()`. Do you know how they work _exactly_, when do they promise to resort to a single `write()` and where can they break it into multiple ones? At least, at `\\n` they probably flush, i.e. break into multiple `write()`s.\n\nMaybe you figure out that `printf()` works with 4kB buffers (it's an example only, I'm not sure this is the buffer size), and flushes whenever it's full or at `\\n`. But is surely won't become full with 200-ish byte progress bar updates, right? Well, very silly example, but maybe one day someone decides to produce rainbow-colored progress bar, each character having a different RGB color, that's 20-ish bytes of escape sequence per character, combined with a 200-column terminal can extend that 4kB buffer, causing a break at an unexpected location.\n\nMaybe you find the low-level yet convenient `dprintf()`. Do you know how it works, in terms of multiple small writes vs. fewer bigger ones? I don't.\n\nMaybe it's all written in some different programming language (I haven't checked), using C++'s `cout` and `<<`, or whatever solution Rust or Go or Python or any other programming language offers. How familiar are you with the exact details of those?\n\nIt definitely requires deep knowledge about the printing functions of the programming language to be (almost) sure that whatever you think you print in a single step is indeed printed as a single step by that function.\n\nYou can verify the behavior with `strace`, but that doesn't tell anything about what will happen if some buffer gets filled up, or on other platforms. It's an observation only, not a promise.\n\n---\n\nSecond, what happens after the data leaves your application?\n\nThe kernel sometimes needs to modify the data, e.g. convert `\\n` to `\\r\\n`. How does it do that? Can it insert breaking points there, or anywhere else? At https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2627#note_1724632 we were really surprised that reads from a tty are often short reads, returning fewer data than already available there. Why? I don't know. A bug in the Linux kernel? Could be. Can it happen anywhere? Can it happen if the buffer always has at most 200-ish bytes? I don't know.\n\nWhat if networking is involved, let's say, old-fashioned `telnet` or `netcat`? Various transport layers have their maximum packet size, e.g. I think it's around 1500 bytes on ethernet. Does it mean that a single step of sending 3000 bytes might easily arrive at the remote party as two consecutive 1500-byte reads? I don't know, possibly.\n\nWhat if `ssh` is involved? Do you know how _exactly_ the protocol looks like, and the sending server and the receiving client work? I don't. Is it possible for them to break the stream at some location? Is it possible that on the server `ollama` prints 200 bytes in a single step, yet the local ssh client prints 100 bytes followed by another 100 bytes in a next step? I don't know.\n\nWhat about `screen` or `tmux`, can they split at unexpected places? I doubt, but maybe.\n\nWhat about accessing a virtual host, like `lxc shell`? There must be some component forwarding the terminal data. Can they split it at places you wouldn't expect? I don't know.\n\nFor some of these, you can probably prove that they cannot split. For some, maybe it's extremely unlikely to split at random places. For some others, maybe it's not even that uncommon.\n\n---\n\nThird, what about the terminal emulator?\n\nA single-threaded one is extremely unlikely to deliberately split an input package and update its UI in the middle.\n\nA multi-threaded one might happen to do this. I haven't taken a look yet at any multi-threaded terminals, but I bet they need to have a mutex between the input processing-parsing thread and the display updating thread, to prevent concurrent access to the buffers (and thus the displaying thread seeing inconsistent and changing data there). If the scope of this mutex is the entire package received as input in a single step then there's no problem. But if the scope of this mutex is smaller, if the scope is individual instructions that modify the buffer, then updating the UI can kick in at the middle, i.e. taking a snapshot when (sticking to ollama's example) the bottom row is empty.\n\n---\n\nThere's a lot of unknown here, and a lot of extremely unlikely and maybe some reasonably likely scenarios that eventually might add up, and I'm quite sure that at least rarely, for a few users out there, with their complex setups, there would be occasional flickers.\n\nSuch a solution would almost certainly be a massive improvement over the current situation, hopefully making flickers very rare, but could never be 100% perfect.",

If this is the case then maybe there is no need to make a big change in those apps, only make sure that they print everything at once instead of having a delay.

            "body": "If I beef up `VTE_CHILD_INPUT_PRIORITY` to `G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE` (100) (instead of its current value `G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE` (200)) then the amount of flickering noticeably decreases, to about its half, which is still way too much.\n\nIn turn, updating the display becomes laggy if large amounts of input is processed.\n\nNote: We keep installing an uninstalling a tick callback that drives the UI updates. I guess we have to uninstall it so that the process doesn't wake up 60 times per second if otherwise nothing happened. The tick callback goes with `GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW` i.e. `G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE + 20` i.e. 120.\n\n---\n\nWhat happens currently in VTE:\n\n- GLib main loop notices that input is available, thus calls `io_read_cb()`.\n- `pty_io_read()` tries to read a large-ish amount, reads 44 bytes.\n- It tries to read a bit more immediately, but there's no more data at this point. (This retry is irrelevant for this investigation.)\n- It processes those 44 bytes, and installs the tick callback to start regularly updating the screen.\n- By this time, the next 144 bytes may or may not have arrived, it doesn't make a difference. The higher priority tick callback is invoked by the main loop, which redraws the canvas (with an empty bottom row).\n- Now the next 144 bytes are available. They are read and processed.\n- (So far all these steps combined took much less than 1/60 seconds.)\n- 1/60 or so seconds later the tick callback is called again, redrawing the canvas (this time with the re-populated bottom row).\n\nIf I modify `VTE_CHILD_INPUT_PRIORITY` to be higher (as in: lower numerical value) than `GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW` then the following changes:\n\nIf those followup 144 bytes arrive while processing the first 44 bytes then the main loop will decide to also process these followup 144 bytes before redrawing the screen. Thus no flicker. A little bit larger window was available for those bytes to arrive on time. But if those 144 bytes still haven't arrived then the display is updated, resulting in a flicker.\n\n---\n\nWhat I guess we _could_ (but I don't think we _should_) do in VTE is: Whenever we decide to install the tick callback, don't actually install it straight away but install it with a tiny, heuristical delay, let's say 1/120th of a second (half of a screen refresh cycle) later.\n\nThe drawback would be: The average latency, as meticulously measured by Ivan in #334 and the linked blog post, would increase by exactly this amount.\n\nAlso, the chosen delay would be absolutely arbitrary: the higher the number, the more flickers are avoided, but also the higher the latency becomes. The lower, the more flickers would remain. I doubt there's a magic number that would be a good compromise: would work pretty reliably with all these broken apps to filter out the vast majority of their flickers, yet not cause an unwanted amount of delay.\n\nThat said, we _could_ maybe experiment with some low values, e.g. around 5ms, to see how much it impacts usability vs. how much it reduces flickers. But I'm still not happy about the idea of increasing latency in _all_ the apps out there, just to _mostly_ work around some bug in a _few_ broken ones.\n\n---\n\nAnother possibility to consider, involving GTK work too:\n\nAs far as I know, the tick callback is not just a repeated 60Hz callback at any random times, but is somehow synchronized to the monitor's refresh cycle / vsync or whatever it's called.\n\nApparently not the first invocation, though, after installing the tick callback. That one happens ASAP (respecting the priorities) from the main loop.\n\nWhat I guess we'd need is a new feature in GTK, telling not to rush with the first invocation but to wait for the first vsync, i.e. call it at a time when it would be called anyway, had it been installed for longer.\n\nNot sure: does it make sense??\n\nOr would _this_ noticeably increase latency, in cases when the redraw is so quick that currently with a decent chance it still makes it into the frame that's already being rendered by the monitor, and thus would be delayed by a frame with this change?\n\nI don't know, we'd need an expert on this area to comment on this idea, which I am definitely not.\n\n---\n\nI still hold my opinion that not only the proper, but also the simplest fix is to fix all those apps out there that emit flickering updates.",

            "body": "> How about my Node.js REPL [...]\n\nIn our warm-up conversation in #2815 I was already pretty certain that this was a problem with the emitter apps. After all, if an application does not touch a certain character cell, there's no way VTE on its own will begin to flicker it.\n\nThen here I analized your `ollama` output and gave a clear proof that it was indeed a problem with this app.\n\nNow you're asking about `lips`. The tiny output you posted is absolutely clear: the cursor is moved to the first column, then ED (Erase in Display) `\\e[0J` erases everything to the cursor's right in the cursor's row, as well as all the lines below. This does include the `lips>` prompt. Then the prompt is re-printed. Just like with `ollama`, there's clear proof here that your utility asks the terminal to erase your prompt and then re-display it later. It does ask for a brief flicker (which may or may not end up on the UI in form of pixels, depending on how processing the input, updating the pixels, and the monitor's refresh cycle go relative to each other).\n\nI cannot tell from the information you've given (lack of timings and whatnot) why the flicker happens with certain keypresses and not with others; nor do I feel like further debugging obviously broken apps, sorry.\n\n> I understand what you're saying that the \"fix\" should be done in those apps. But why this should happen if it worked perfectly fine before and suddenly only in one Terminal it's \"broken\".\n\nIt's not true that the overall behavior is only broken in one terminal. You yourself have already said that you're facing occasional flickers in xterm. And you did not answer my question: If you're bothered by these flickers, why would you happily settle with a solution that has fewer of them, why don't you aim for having none at all?\n\nA recent change in VTE, by pure accident, made it more obvious that these broken apps are indeed broken. It's nothing unprecedented here, the world of software development is full of examples when an unrelated change happens to reveal a bug elsewhere. (For example, this very scheduling change of VTE happened to reveal a long-standing and previously extremely rare bug in VTE's scrollback buffer handling, which we had to locate and fix -- and of course fine-tuning the new scheduler's parameters to hide that bug was not an option.)\n\nA change (_not_ a newly introduced bug, but a new behavior which is just as correct as the previous one) in VTE coincidentally happens to make some bugs of some other apps more prominent. Work on getting those bugs fixed, please.\n\n> I don't think that it's feasible to fix this in Node.js\n\nWhy not? The bug is there, not in VTE.\n\n> Yes Node.js will also need to make a breaking change just to \"fix\" a \"bug\" in VTE.\n\nWhat breaking change??? They currently produce broken output, output that does request a flicker. They need to fix it, to produce an output that does not request a flicker. That's not a breaking change, that's a fixing change.\n\n> The reason why I think the issue should be \"fixed\" in VTE is because it introduced a breaking change, and it's a single project responsible for that breaking change. It's easier to fix the issue in one project than fix hundreds of them that may be as difficult as fixing VTE.\n\nThere are three things here I'd like to mention.\n\nFirst, again, new VTE isn't the first where this bug occurs, it's just perhaps the first where it's quite prominent.\n\nSecond, I think you might underestimate the cost of \"fixing\" it in VTE. It's not just a simple fine-tuning of a parameter, or a missing one-liner. The scheduler would have to receive presumably fundamental changes. Reverting to the old one, with much lower frame rate and much higher latency, is not an option. We'd need to find some solution that is as effective performance-wise as the new code, plus provides a workaround here. I think that modifying VTE's behavior to please these broken apps is significantly harder than changing some escape sequences and shuffling around some printfs in a few dozen of such broken apps. But maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, it's irrelevant, because:\n\nThe third thing is: It doesn't matter which one is cheaper. It's not the cheaper (in terms of developer cost) or quicker (as in: implemented the sooner the better) fix or workaround that developers have to go for. Developers have to go for the fix that is the architecturally correct one, the fix that results in the cleaner state of things (no nasty workarounds, heuristics, second-guessing what that other party wanted to say rather than what it actually said, but doing in the first place what you really want to do), the fix that works not 99.999% but 100% of the time. And that \"fix\" just cannot be that apps request for a flicker and all the terminals out there fully reliably eliminate them. The fix is for these apps not to request a flicker.\n\nPlease focus on getting those apps fixed (at least file a bug against them; but it sounds like an easy warm-up task for any new contributor that I presume you yourself can also fix with reasonable effort in any of them).",

            "body": "> The problem with this is that a lot of apps would need to be updated.\n\nLet's update those lots of buggy apps, then. I don't see a problem with this.\n\nThe fix to them is extremely easy. It's along the lines of emitting a `\\e[K` (clear to the end of the line) after printing the updated line, rather than a `\\e[2K` (clear the entire line) before printing the updated one. I.e. slightly changing and shuffling around a few `printf()`s, or alike. The amount of work is measured in minutes. Maybe an hour, but that includes all the boilerplate of manually testing on a wide variety of terminals, unittests, code review, and whatnot.\n\n(Note: care has to be taken that if an entire line is printed then `\\e[K` wipes out the last character on most terminals (not on VTE though). If an entire line is printed then this sequence shouldn't be emitted. It's recommended to leave the last character of the row out of this game, as in the example you provided, so that the cursor doesn't interfere with the contents, and also so that `\\e[K` works as expected.)\n\nContrary to this, \"fixing\" VTE might require heavy modifications to VTE, beginning with having to understand how its big picture with processing input goes. If I were to do it, I estimate it to take multiple days, possibly over a week to understand the code and refactor without regressions. I am personally extremely unlikely to do it, as I'm no longer active in the project wrt. nontrivial tasks. The two Christians on the project are much more familiar with that area of the code and could certainly do it quicker than me, but a few recent problems there (during the aforementioned big refactoring of 0.76 and having to track then down) showed that they're not 100% fluent with that code area either, I assume it wouldn't be a trivial task for them either. I cannot tell how they prioritize this \"bug\" and how likely they are to work on it any time soon.\n\nFixing a few dozens of apps that produce flickery output is presumably much smaller amount of work than working them around in VTE.\n\nAlso note how I'm referring to \"bug\" and \"fixing\" VTE in quotes. VTE is not broken. Whatever it does in response to the received input, is absolutely legit. It's not the ideal behavior, it could be improved to please such apps, but it's not broken per se by any means.\n\n> The problem with this is that a lot of apps would need to be updated. From what I see, it's common to clear the line, write new content.\n\nI can't recall off the top of my head ever encountering such behavior from an app. Look at all the software out there that could be considered as reference. Shells (bash with its readline, and others), screen drawing libraries (most notably ncurses), popular utilities that do their own screen drawing (vim, emacs, less, top...) all show that this is _not_ how to update the screen.\n\n> And in case of my small project LIPS, I would need to fix the issue in Node.js itself, and it will not flicker only in latest version when it will be merged.\n\nHow is it any different if a workaround goes into VTE? Then you'd also need to wait for the fix to be created, released, and make it into your system. The lifecycle of how an update arrives at your system is not a pro or con for the fix to go into either component.\n\nThe fix (or maybe workaround) needs to go into whichever component(s) it belongs to in the long run, not whichever component could ship that fix (or workaround) quicker to you.\n\n> And fixing those tools, so they work on new version of Terminals that use VTE, sounds odd.\n\nUsing the word \"work\" here is harsh and unjustified. They do work in VTE. There's an annoying flickering, but other than that, they're fine.\n\nYou know what's odd in my book? In my book it's odd to not acknowledge if a piece of software is broken and fix it over there, but instead expecting another software to work it around.\n\nYou are annoyed by this flickering to the extent that you started tracking down the relevant component and reported it. I can totally understand that. What I cannot understand: How come you could be satisfied with a solution that noticeably reduces the amount of flickering, but doesn't completely eliminate them? Because it's clear that no matter what VTE would do, there would still be some flickering remaininig. You yourself also say at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2322799#c7 that xterm also flickers. If I were you, and if I were personally annoyed by these flickers, I would want _all_ of them to be gone.\n\nVTE cannot fully fix the problem, nor can any other terminal. VTE could, by putting a significant amount of work into it, mitigate the problem, but it would still remain to some extent. It's much simpler, easier, cleaner, cheaper to fix the actual buggy emitting apps.\n\n---\n\nWhile at it, back to the analysis of the problem for a sec.\n\nInitially (while the progress bar only has a single Unicode character at each end) an update consists of 188 bytes. Such an update is sent out once every 0.1 seconds. The 44th byte of this string is a `\\n`. Clearing both lines and repainting the first line happens before it, repainting the second line happens after it.\n\nIn the emitter app, it's probably 187 bytes, with `\\n` being the 43rd; a preceding `\\r` is inserted by the kernel's tty line discipline.\n\nAs seen in the timings, the newline is often a breaking point: `script` stopped receiving input there momentarily. This is probably due to the emitter app using line-buffered stdio (although that wouldn't explain the breaking point at offset 3012, so I might be wrong with line-buffered stdio here). Also I'm not sure if the kernel is any likely to insert a breaking point at `\\n` where it inserts the preceding `\\r`, I doubt but I cannot exclude this.\n\nWhile not clearing the text that's about to be overridden is the desired solution, not pausing at a linebreak would go a long way and would presumably mitigate the problem probably to similar extent than any terminal could. So even if the app insists of using this pattern of clearing the line first, it could rearrange the segments so that the line is cleared _immediately_ before re-populating it (most importantly: with no newline in between), and/or use direct non-buffered writes to not have an implicit flush at the newline character.\n\nThe emitter app sends a bunch of instructions, including to clear the bottom status line; and a tad bit later (in a separate followup package) sends another bunch of instructions, including to re-populate that bottom status line with its updated contents. You expect the terminal to recognize this situation and not to paint the intermediate state. I firmly disagree with your conclusion. It would be a nice-to-have, but not an expectation from any terminal.\n\nEven if the two instructions were sent in the very same package, there'd be no guarantee that an underlying component (kernel, networking, ssh, tmux, whatever) couldn't split them with some delay in between, or some terminal emulator itself (especially a multi-threaded one) couldn't take a snapshot and render the contents between those instructions. The chance of getting a flicker would become much lower, though.\n\nThe only 100% robust solution for an emitter app is not to clear the cells that are subsequently re-populated with similar (or identical) characters. Sending out the clearing and the re-populating instructions in a single step presumably gets you _almost_ there, with very few flickers. Sending them in two consecutive steps: no, just don't do that if you want a flicker-free experience. Just don't.\n\n---\n\nPlease repeat the analyzing steps that I performed for the other apps that you also have a problem with, and file a bugreport along with the analysis (also linking to this bug if you wish to) against them.",

            "body": "`timing.log` is a bit hard to read manually. Obviously each line is a time to wait (in seconds) and the number of bytes to print. The header line of `session.log` is excluded.\n\nIn order to make it more readable, I modified the file using this script to include the absolute offset of `session.log` where the data fragment begins. The header line's length is hardcoded.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\noffset=110\nwhile read a b; do\n  echo $a $offset $b\n  offset=$((offset+b))\ndone\n```\n\nIts output goes like\n\n```\n0.888364 110 18\n0.010993 128 28\n```\n\nmeaning to wait for 0.88 seconds, then from offset 110 print 18 bytes, then wait for 0.01 seconds, then from offset 128 print 28 bytes etc.\n\nThis can easily be examined together with `session.log` in any text editor that displays the cursor's offset in bytes.\n\n---\n\nLooking at `session.log`, almost every line goes like:\n\n- print \"pulling e554... 0% [progress bar] [speed]\"\n- show cursor\n- (note: according to the timing log, this is where a 0.1 second delay occurs)\n- hide cursor\n- clear the cursor's line (`\\e[2K`) (!!!)\n- go to column 1\n- go 1 row up\n- clear the cursor's line (another `\\e[2K`) (!!!)\n- go to column 1\n- print \"pulling manifest\"\n- carriage return (go to column 1)\n- linefeed (go back to the bottom row)\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely clearly the emitter app produces data that is supposed to flicker. It clears the text before overwriting with the new one. It should overwrite without clearing, and only clear the parts that are meant to be cleared.\n\nAny terminal emulator, upon its own discretion, might at any time pause reading its input and go ahead and update its display, and after that resume processing input. It's the nature of this game. And of course multiple terminal emulators will behave differently; one might be better in some aspect (or for some apps), another might be better in some other aspects (or for some other apps).\n\nTo make it worse, VTE doesn't just randomly, out of thin air decide to pause reading. There _is_ a delay in its input at points where the status line is erased. According to the timing log, the data often stops momentarily, for a tiny-tiny fraction of a second, at an offset that's the beginning of a line of `session.log`, i.e. the beginning of the loop as shown above. At byte offset 1151 for 0.000089 seconds, at byte offset 1339 for 0.000223 seconds etc. VTE happens to update its UI at these points. At these points the bottom row is meant to be empty, that's what the emitter app asks from the terminal emulator.\n\nAbsolutely clearly a bug in the emitter app.\n\n---\n\nThat being said...\n\nI guess there's room in VTE to improve the heuristics of when to update the canvas or when to read more data from the pty. After all, it pretty often decides to update the canvas when some data is pretty much immediately followed by more data.\n\nMaybe the algorithm could be modified so that in case of such tiny delays between two chunks it would continue consuming input, i.e. it would process the next pretty much immediately available piece of data.\n\nThe way we hook up to the GLib main loop to watch the file descriptors, the frame clock to do the UI updates, the cooperation between multiple VTE widgets for each of them to play fairly (a part of the code that I never managed to understand), combined with making sure that throughput doesn't regress significantly, and let's also mention #200 here...; it might not be easy, or feasible at all, to implement it; I can't tell.\n\nAnyway, implementing this would make it significantly less likely for a flicker to appear, but could never entirely eliminate it. It's the emitter app's responsibility to simply overwrite previous text without erasing it first, it will never flicker then.\n\n---\n\n\n> This is a regression, it was working few months ago.\n\nVTE version 0.76 received significant architectural changes hereabouts, resulting in a higher display refresh rate (60Hz or I guess whatever your monitor's refresh rate is, compared to its earlier 20-40-ish Hz), thereby also a much lower latency, and also an about 2x throughput. This might have also had an effect on when VTE decides to continue reading its input and when it decides to update its UI.",

Also the right place to discuss that is a clean new bug here, not on some other forum. But I'm pretty sure that you have no case here: `dnf`/`lips` ask VTE to remove a piece of text and a little bit later they ask VTE to print some new text there (or with `lips`: to reprint the old text), and that's exactly what VTE does.",

Maybe you're in this IM mode, and that 007F is the first byte of some complex character that you're composing??\n\nThis would mean that both problems are at the same place: around your keyboard layout / IM, or at least VTE's / Ptyxis's interpretation of them.\n\nAre you on X11 or Wayland? One way to tell is `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`. Can you try the other platform, too? Keyboard handling is quite different in them, as far as I know. (Does Fedora 41 still include X11 or have they dropped it? I'm not sure.)",

This is what seems to appear on your screenshot, too.\n\nPart of the story is that somehow your Delete key seems to behave as if your keyboard had a key for this Arabic letter and you pressed that key. Maybe this is what you're primarily worried about.\n\nHowever, the boxed 007F isn't explained yet and isn't contained in your logs. I'm also worried about this part of the story.\n\nCould you please repeat the experiment like this (sorry if my instructions weren't clear):\n\nRun `script -I log-input.txt -O log-output.txt` (with no command). It drops you into a shell and starts recording. In this `zsh` shell please repeat the example that also resulted in that boxed 007F appearing in place of the letter `i` of the word `install`.\n\nOnce done, exit this `zsh` shell. You'll get a \"Script done\" message. This is when the log files are complete. Please attach them as they contain your communication with that `zsh`, including what triggered that boxed 007F appearing.",

The download phase, e.g. at \"13/93\", where the bottom of the output goes up by a few lines? Seems like it's the intentional behavior of `dnf` when it reports the progress of multiple parallel downloads. Or the installation phase where the bottom row is sometimes empty for a short period? Again looks to me that's what dnf asks it to display, it probably completes the previous line (with a newline) and then waits for a little while before filling up the new line with data. The \"lips\" prompt? We have no idea what that app does, but shells and apps using the readline library show you how to implement a flicker-free prompt.\n\nI see absolutely no evidence of VTE doing anything differently than what it's being asked to do.\n\nCan you try some terminal emulators that are _not_ based on VTE, preferably some modern fast ones, and confirm the same behavior there?\n\nLooks to me like a \"bug\" (or at least unfortunate, unpleasant behavior) in `dnf` as well as your in-house app.\n\nWhat changed in VTE recently, in version 0.76, is that it's faster than it used to be and updates its canvas more frequently. This could be a reason for any such flickering to be a bit more visible to you. Previously VTE updated its canvas approximately 20-40 times per second (I don't know how frequently exactly). Newest versions update them according to the monitor's refresh rate, i.e. typically 60 times per second, maybe even more frequently. If an app asks to clear the bottom row, and about 1/60th seconds later asks to populate it with new data, then yes, you are going to see a flicker. It's a problem with that app.\n\n(Oh, and again, it's totally offtopic here, unrelated to what this very bug is about.)",

DEL or DELETE control character should never be able to make it into our buffers.\n\nDo you see the same behavior in other terminal emulators as well, or is it only Ptyxis?

In particular, if an app asks to remove a line and a bit later asks to paint it with new contents (or maybe re-paint it with the previous contents), you'll obviously see a flicker. If the emitter app doesn't insert a delay then still a delay can occur due to other circumstances.\n\nIf an app wants its output to be flickerless, it's that app that needs to make sure that it doesn't wipe out the contents just to re-paint them shortly afterwards. It should print the new contents, overwriting the previous ones, without any step in between. You'll have to file a bugreport against those emitting apps.\n\nOr, if scrolling is involved, like printing the same one-liner over and over again in a loop (e.g. the command `yes lorem ipsum`), this flickering in the bottom row is essentially unavoidable: at any time it's possible that the terminal emulator has only processed a partial line, and therefore the rest of that line is still empty, when it comes to updating its display.\n\nBut at least if the given app, let's say `dnf` in order to update a few lines of scrollbars, prints a reasonable amount of output in a single `write()`-like syscall then such flickers will be quite rare.",

Please don't do that; instead use a stable release (latest is 0.78.1) or at least the stable branch (latest is vte-0-78). Fast_float was only added on master (to be version 0.80).\n\nYeah, [I realized that afterwards](https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Galaxy-Flasher/issues/23#issuecomment-2426730722) :grimacing: .\n\n> I guess you don't have network access while running the build.\nYou could build a release of fast_float before starting the vte build, and then the \"system fast_float\" check should succeed.\nI'd be interested in how other projects are solving this \"meson subproject needs to be checked out but there is no network access\" problem.\n\nYeah, it was in a flatpak build, in which case I think it doesn't have access to the internet. So you're right, fast_float might have to be built first.\n\n> BTW: in the linked bug, you say\n\n> I'll be glad to not have Vte as a dependency in the next release, people keep having issues with it building.\n\n> Were any of these issues reported here?\n\nNo, there was only [one other issue](https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Galaxy-Flasher/issues/19) related to VTE not building, something with minifont-coverage. That may have also been due to using the latest master branch though.\n\nSo the main issue was me using the latest source, instead of a stable release. :blush:\n\nWas fast_float not used in prior releases then? If VTE is trying to build fast_float, that means my fast_float version isn't new enough, right? TIA, and sorry about me badmouthing VTE.",

I'd expect `meson`/`ninja` to work fully offline, and I'd also expect `meson`/`ninja` not to modify anything outside of the build directory.\n\nAlso not sure what to do with the tarball, i.e. whether to include this subdirectory there or not, and if not then how would building from a tarball go.\n\nAnother possibility is not to use any subproject thingy, but to copy those files into our repository (assuming it's permitted by its license).\n\nReferring back to #2823, I still think that\n\n> unwanted skew in the accepted inputs between normal vte and vte on libc++\n\nis not that bad, it might not be worth the price of this whole `fast_float` hassle to cope with that.",

I changed the subproject to fix the include path, so please try `rm -rf subprojects/fast_float` in the toplevel source dir, then try again; hopefully that fixes it.\n\n> With those two new commits, without the libfast-float-dev package installed, Ubuntu 24.10, gcc 14.2.0, starting from clean repo:\n\nI committed a change to meson.build to do a compile check instead of a simple header presence check; can you see if the result of that for your system installation is a fail as expected, and then it should fall back to the subproject?\n\n> It's a header-only library that jumped 3 major versions in less than 2 years. Header-only means that it probably doesn't have to worry that much about backwards compability than a runtime-linked one would have to, dunno. Anyway, I'm somewhat worried about its future robustness.\n\nI'm not worried; it seems well-used as seen [here](https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float/?tab=readme-ov-file#users-and-related-work).\n\n> Just wondering: isn't there a completely different, more robustly widely available solution? Like, good old-fashioned atof()/sscanf()? :smile: \n\nWell, I want to use more C++, not less :-) `std::from_chars` was supposed to be that, but for some reason it's not available everywhere yet. (Also, fast_float is even better than `std::from_chars` since it works with any char type, so we could e.g. omit the extra utf-32 to utf-8 conversion on the OSC control string, but that's future work.)\n\n> We're getting into a ridiculous amount of build system complexity and way too many problems for the supposedly simple task of parsing a number (where I assume we don't need the speed, nor the accuracy (like rounding to even) that this library provides).\n\nI'd really like to get this system header/subproject fallback working, and not just for fast_float but taking the opportunity to try to work out how to depend on a c++ lib since I want to add more such dependencies (mostly header only) in future. And since this here is apparently necessary to build on some BSDs, I don't want to go into the `#ifdef` business, esp. since the build system complications would still be required anyway. \n\n(Btw, if you do want to go for \"strtof\" (maybe that's a good solution for 0-78 at least), it needs to use `g_ascii_strtod` instead of the locale-aware `strto[fd]`.)",

I think it's okay if we need a newer version, but then I think we should prefer the bundled one and reject the system version (or check that it's new enough). No idea how much work that is with meson/cmake.\n\n---\n\nTaking 1 step back:\n\nIt's a header-only library that jumped 3 major versions in less than 2 years. Header-only means that it probably doesn't have to worry _that_ much about backwards compability than a runtime-linked one would have to, dunno. Anyway, I'm somewhat worried about its future robustness.\n\nJust wondering: isn't there a completely different, more robustly widely available solution? Like, good old-fashioned `atof()`/`sscanf()`? :) We're getting into a ridiculous amount of build system complexity and way too many problems for the supposedly simple task of parsing a number (where I assume we don't need the speed, nor the accuracy (like rounding to even) that this library provides).",

Perhaps the commit log should say \"Hopefully fixes...\" :)\n\n@chpe Could you please commit and cherry-pick to 0-78 and 0-76 (maybe further back but meh who cares about those) and tag a release this weekend?",

So I guess the fixes are okay.\n\nThanks! Could you please submit, cherry-picking to 0-78 too?

One is that `m_draw` is supposed to render the entire top row, and then this work canvas will be placed on top of the actual canvas with a slight vertical offset. This, however, would need further code modifications at many-many (chpe cross-posted at this exact moment :)) other places. So I'd rule out this possibility.\n\nThe other is that `fill_cell_background()` needs to handle the partial row, i.e. needs a pixel vertical offset, and it was a simple oversight from you that you didn't think of this possibility. That is, its API is not flexible enough. But once it takes a pixel offset vertically, taking a cell offset horizontally would make it a truly weird API. It should then take both offsets as pixel, for code symmetry and cleanness. And once we're here, I don't see the point in this wrapper method any more. I'd just remove it altogether and revert to using `fill_rectangle()`.",

Maybe it's just the way I work, but a good fix should really build upon a solid understanding of the faulty situation. To clarify: I'm not saying the patch is bad, maybe it is good, but it takes more to convince me.\n\nchpe is probably more familiar with this area of the code and he might be easier to convince, or might see straight away why this patch is correct (or why it's not), I don't know.\n\nUpdate (after one more round of testing):\n\nWith continuous output (no `sleep` in the loop), although processing the input now stops, the selection is still not always highlighted visually. So there's more to this story. But at least while testing this I spotted a brand new painting bug that sneaked in with one of the recent commits, so that's something :)",

There are not too many calls to it, and one call that immediately stood out is from `Terminal::process` (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/blob/6c2761f51a0400772f443f12ea23a75576e195d3/src/vte.cc#L11172-L11195). It looks like it more or less unconditionally enables the output every time it's called (if only `pty()` returns `true`).\n\nWhat I don't have a clear understanding of yet is where the `Terminal::process` call is coming from.\n\nIn any case, with the change below selection while scrolling seems to work at least, and no more output is produced while the mouse button is kept pressed. Does this look more correct to you @egmontkob?\n\n```diff\ndiff --git src/vte.cc src/vte.cc\nindex 565fa603..13b3c238 100644\n--- src/vte.cc\n+++ src/vte.cc\n@@ -11172,7 +11172,7 @@ Terminal::time_process_incoming()\n bool\n Terminal::process()\n {\n-        if (pty()) {\n+        if (pty() && !m_selecting) {\n                 if (m_pty_input_active ||\n                     m_pty_input_source == 0) {\n                         m_pty_input_active = false;\n```",

This doesn't result in the invalidation of the ringview, even though it really needs to be updated with one more row.\n\n(From the user's point of view, this might be a larger opaque resize, it's just that VTE sees a series of small ones.)\n\nA quick and totally okay fix to this could (and should) be to move the ringview invalidation out of the big `if` branch (`set_size()`'s second half), make it happen all the time when the widget is resized. (Speaking of which, I guess we should do the same for the following few lines as well: invalidate the UI, the regex matches, maybe emit a11y text modified too (although I have no idea how we handle non-integer scroll offsets and partial rows in a11y).)\n\n---\n\nBack to ringview invalidation, for a bit of code health / consistency:\n\nAt many places, such as at `hyperlink_check_at()` which we're looking at, the code goes like:\n\n        if (!m_ringview.is_updated())\n                ringview_update();\n\nArguably it's usually a tad bit cheaper, but in turn less safe than the second approach will be: if the ringview incorrectly remained marked as updated, although essential properties have changed (like the number of lines increased by 1, as in our current case), it remains broken.\n\nAt other places, such as e.g. `draw_rows()`, the condition is skipped and the code is simply:\n\n        ringview_update();\n\nThis is arguably a tad bit slower, but is more robust. The implementation of `ringview_update()` begins with a lots of `set_*()` methods, setting all the essential parameters of the ringview (e.g. which lines it covers). All these `set_*()` methods do mark the ringview as invalid if the property actually changes. Finally, the last `m_ringview.update()` call updates the ringview if it's invalid.\n\nThis is still not a forced update: if the text changes but accidentally isn't marked so, it won't update (which shortcut is essential for good performance). But it guarantees to update if any of the metadata changes. So I guess that using this shorter form in `hyperlink_check_at()` would have saved us. Also, since `draw_rows()` uses this short form, I guess the crash is only reproducible within the first UI update frame after the resize, making it pretty rare.\n\nAre we okay with unifying the code, making it more robust, and presumably not any measurably slower, by switching to the latter one-liner everywhere?",

I.e. would we abort on a failing `vte_assert()`, like the out-of-bounds `row` checks [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/blob/0.78.0/src/ringview.hh?ref_type=tags#L83)?\n\n---\n\nAs far as I can see right now:\n\n`hyperlink_check_at()` makes sure that `m_ringview` is updated using our standard pattern:\n\n        if (!m_ringview.is_updated())\n                ringview_update();\n\nwhereas `ringview_update()` makes sure that `m_ringview` covers the area from the `first_displayed_row()` to (at least) the `last_displayed_row()`.\n\nThat is: at this point we either have a correct `m_ringview`, or it is out-of-date but accidentally marked as valid.\n\nIn the RingView code, allocing/reallocing/deallocing `m_bidirows` looks good to me, its capacity is always at least the number of required rows (`m_len`) unless it's `pause()`'d, and all its allocated members are always a non-null `new BidiRow()`'ed pointer. The `pause()`/`resume()`/`set_size()` bits seem to always correctly maintain this as an array of non-null pointers.\n\nNext, `hyperlink_check_at()` calls `rowcol_at()` which in turn calls `grid_coords_from_view_coords()` which in turns calls `confine_grid_row(row)` which confines `row` to the `first_displayed_row()`..`last_displayed_row()` interval before we're getting to the `get_bidirow()` lookup that returns NULL.\n\nThis seems to be okay to me, and seems to even safely tolerate out-of-widget mouse click coordinates.\n\nUnless I failed to spot a bug in the aforementioned methods that I think I've carefully reviewed and look okay to me, there's one more possibility that I can see: `m_ringview` is outdated but incorrectly marked as valid, the first and last displayed rows have changed since then, the assertions that would fail in `get_bidirow()` are skipped, and an out-of-bounds array lookup just happens to find a pointer's worth of zeros in the memory.\n\nSo, if I'm on the right track... who and when can change the scrolling position (or scrolling boundaries?) without invalidating the RingView?? I don't know.\n\nJust wondering: can this, by any chance, be related to overscrolling in GTK4??",

So if you have a solid background color and a background texture, that's 2 draw passes, and it would be nice if you could avoid the solid color.\n\nGTK with its occlusion culling should be smart enough to avoid the solid color if the texture is opaque. But for transparent textures it can't do that.  \nBut initializing the background data to the background color and then using `GDK_MEMORY_R8G8B8X8` for the data type would work - at least as long as the background color is opaque.\n\nI have no idea if that's a big gain, but you might be able to benchmark it on software rendering, like llvmpipe or maybe even Cairo.",

Is the \"mpv tct\" use case a realistic one? Because drawing the foreground into the background seems like a bit weird.\n\nYeah exactly that. I wanted to test it just to see \"how much savings there is to have\" and while it is double digit improvement, it is still pretty minor in my opinion. I think effort on the ingestion pipeline is much more valuable across the board than this.\n\nAnother thing I thought of randomly this morning was that we could probably make `clear()` use the background too.

I guess that `m_background_set` optimises for the case we don't draw any bg since all cells have default bg; is that optimisation important?\n\nCommitted to master; do you want this on 0-78 too?\n\nAs for the \"half-height\" blocks, you mean to enlarge this background bitmap so it has 2 lines of pixels for each line, so that you can actually draw a half block? Is the \"mpv tct\" use case a realistic one? Because drawing the foreground into the background seems like a bit weird.\n\n> faster PTY ingestion\n\nOk! I did notice previously (#200) that data from the PTY gets read in weirdly small sizes, but haven't investigated that since.",

Since this program was originally developed for the Windows console, it heavily utilizes its advantages, particularly the ability to use any key combinations.\n\nWhen migrating from Windows to Linux, users look for a familiar UX; they need their favorite applications, not a new operating system.  If we tell them \"learn 100 new keyboard shortcuts,\" they're more likely to stay on Windows than listen to us.\n\nIs it really acceptable that *nix console capabilities in the 21st century are still inferior to those of the ancient Windows 2000 console? This situation needs improvement.\n\nIn the far2l project, we came up with a hack that solves the problem under X11: we simply connect to X11 and listen to all keyboard input. This allows us to \"refine\" the key press information coming into the terminal, \"deciphering\" what the user actually pressed. A terrible, horribly dirty hack (but it works!)\u2014but better than depriving the user of familiar functionality.\n\nHowever, with the widespread transition to Wayland, this hack stops working.  What do you think users will do, give up their familiar keyboard shortcuts\u2014or stay on X11?\n\nThis is precisely why we need the ability to use any keyboard shortcut in console applications. Not the day after tomorrow, not tomorrow. We needed it yesterday.\n\nOf all the available solutions (far2l terminal extensions, iTerm2 raw keyboard protocol, win32-input-mode, and kitty keyboard protocol), the kitty protocol is the most suitable for UNIX-like operating systems. It's designed with backward compatibility in mind, and adapting terminals to support it is straightforward. Look at this code example. This is a reference implementation of basic kitty protocol support that I made as an example for Windows Terminal developers.  It's only 196 lines of code: https://gist.github.com/unxed/d979fe069039fe075c18eb0218b1f8f5\n\nI hope you will consider these arguments, and together we can bring the console capabilities of UNIX-like operating systems up to par with what the Windows 2000 console offered 24 years ago. I'll be happy to answer any questions if anyone takes this on.  Thank you in advance!",

I don't like this because AFAIK from_chars is stricter in which input syntax it accepts, which would lead to an unwanted skew in the accepted inputs between normal vte and vte on libc++.\n* Use [fast_float](https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float) as a subproject (or import the headers directly)\n* Keep using vte 0.76.\n\nMore ideas?",
